              I think that I shall never @{see: verb, one syllable}
              A poem @{lovely: adjective, two syllables, accent on the first} as a @{tree: singular of @Trees@}.

              A @{tree} whose @{hungry: adjective, two syllables, accent on the first} @{mouth: noun, one syllable} is @{prest: verb, past tense, one syllable}
              Upon the @{earth: noun there is only one of, one syllable}â€™s @{sweet: adjective, one syllable} flowing @{breast: body part, one syllable, rhyming with @prest@};

              A @{tree} that @{looks: verb, third person singular, one syllable} at God all @{day: length of time, one syllable},
              And lifts her leafy @{arms: body part, one syllable, plural} to @{pray: verb, one syllable, rhyming with @day@};

              Who intimately lives with @{rain: substance, one syllable, rhyming with @lain@}.

              Poems are made by @{fools: type of person, plural, one syllable} like @{me: noun, one syllable, rhyming with @tree@},
              But only God can make a @{tree}.
