            I think that I shall never @{see: verb, one syllable}

            A @{tree} that @{looks: verb, third person singular, one syllable} at God all @{day: length of time, one syllable},
            And lifts her leafy @{arms: body part, one syllable, plural} to @{pray: verb, one syllable, rhyming with @day@};

            Who intimately lives with @{rain: substance, one syllable, rhyming with @lain@}.
