# GruttyPeen

This is a silly little toy I thought up many years ago... then got around to
actually creating a few years ago... and added some polish and finally put it
out for public consumption just in time for my friend Tara's 42nd birthday
party.  Hi Tara!

It's essentially Mad Libs for poetry.  That's why it asks you for words
that fit not only a given part of speech, but a given number of syllables and
accent, and maybe also rhyme with another.  The name comes from a name of a
race of aliens known for their horrible poetry, in "The Hitchhiker's Guide to
the Galaxy", by Douglas Adams.

Eventually I will document the template format, so you can submit
poems.  Meanwhile, if you have _well known, short, public domain_
poems to suggest, you can contact me through
[my web site](http://www.davearonson.com).

*DISCLAIMER:* this app is _not_ in any way approved, endorsed, etc., by Douglas
Adams, his estate, his publisher(s), the relevant holder(s) of the copyrights,
trademarks, or other types of Intellectual Property, nor those of Mad Libs.  I
believe this to be a permitted usage of both items (and possibly the poems!)
under the parody provisions of the Fair Use doctrine.
