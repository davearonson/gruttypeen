<p>
Fill in a response for each description.&nbsp;
It may be one word or more,
just so long as the part of speech, number of syllables, and accent are right.&nbsp;
Why?&nbsp;
Because we like you, er, I mean, because it's poetry!&nbsp;
Then click Submit, and see what you've created.&nbsp;
(Eventually you'll be able to save it too.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, you can save it from your browser,
or take a screenshot.)
</p>

<p>If you'd rather use a different poem, <%= link_to("go here", root_path) %>.&nbsp; You'll get a random one out of our collection of <%= Poem.count %>.</p>
